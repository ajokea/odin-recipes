        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This vanilla bean ice cream is pure, rich, and creamy. Only the good stuff, nothing artificial about it. It's 5-ingredient bliss!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/2 cups whole milk</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups heavy cream</li>
            <li>1 whole vanilla bean</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>3 large egg yolks</li>
            <li>1/2 cup cane sugar</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine milk and cream in medium saucepan. Using sharp knife, split vanilla bean in half, lengthwise.  Scrape out all the seeds into the saucepan. Put bean pod in saucepan; there is plenty of flavor left in pod. Bring mixture to slow boil.  Reduce heat to simmer 30 minutes.  Stir frequently. If you get a little milky film on top, just keep stirring.</li>
            <li>Combine 2 eggs, 3 yolks, and sugar in a medium bowl. Lightly beat until mixture is thick, smooth, and pale yellow. Remove bean pod from milk mixture.  Measure out 1 cup of the hot mixture.  Gradually pour the cup of milk mixture into the egg mixture in a slow, steady stream while whisking - you can also use a mixer on low speed. When combined, pour egg/milk mixture back into saucepan.</li>
            <li>Stir constantly over low heat until mixture is thick enough to coat spoon. Do not let it boil. If using thermometer, it should be around 170F.</li>
            <li>Transfer to a bowl, cover with plastic wrap directly over custard, and chill completely. Takes at least a few hours chill, so do this overnight if you like.</li>
            <li>Pour chilled custard into ice cream maker and churn until thickened, about 25 min. Transfer to airtight container and place in freezer to set.</li>
        </ol>
